<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student of Software Engineering at [ChongQing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/). My research involves edge intelligence (model partition and model compression), reinforcement learning for edge caching and computing offloading, and defect detection at multi-access edge-cloud computing networks.


## Research Interest:
- **Model Partition:**  Fine-grained model partitioning for distributed inference, joint model partition and compression
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-learning, DQN, DDQN, Actor-Critic and DDPG methods
- **Content Caching:** Mobility-aware content caching, LFM-based content caching
- **Defect Detection:** Transfer learning for real-time surface defect detection
